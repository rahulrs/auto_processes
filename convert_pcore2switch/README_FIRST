Convert a pcore to switch python script
=======================================
Author : Rahul

*** WARNING: Slightly buggy BETA code, also missing sanity checks ***

- The sole puspose of this script is to create a switch with local
  link ports.
- To use this:
  - First create a pcore with 1 slave register (it is important that
    only 1 slave register exists in the pcore)
  - Copy or sym-link the pcore2switch.py file to the
    pcores/<target_pcore> directory
  - Run the python script as:
    python pcore2switch.py 
    In order to configure airen_common.vhd, a few prompts will be made
    to the user.
- Check the VHDL, MPD and PAO files.
