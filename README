This is a set of all my beloved scripts that have made my research
life just that bit simpler.

Most are FPGA, cross-compilation, HDL analysis or building linux
related.

WARNING: Most of these scripts are extremely ferocious in their
working and can wipe out your work if you dont take care to back up
your work. Many are defunct and require cleaning up or revving-up. Any
mishaps caused by these scripts on your machine are completely your
own misdoing.

I am not legally liable for any negative effects (loss of data,
destruction of project) due to running these scripts. So beware.
